# Demo QA Testing

Hi — I'm learning test automation. This repo has a few simple Selenium tests I wrote while practicing.

What is here

- Basic pytest tests: alerts, browser windows, and a form submission.


Notes

- I used `webdriver-manager` so you usually don't need to download browser drivers yourself.
- These tests were written for learning — they may need tweaks on different browsers or OS versions.
- If installs fail, try `python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel` and then retry.
